        <p>China is facing a shrinking labor force and younger people are being forced to work longer hours in order to compensate for the decrease in numbers to keep up the same amount of productivity. With this increasing pressure, a ‘lying flat’ movement has taken root in the youth culture that is not necessarily anti-work, but against the pressure-filled work environment, as well as social expectation.</p>
        <p class="blank">Blank</p>
        <p>Chinese censorship is often chalked up to being anything directly against the government or mentioning the Taiwan or Hong Kong situation. However, the posts from this movement were also censored. Posts from this movement were quick to be censored as it went against the promotion of the economic growth of China and threatens the already slowing birth rate.</p>

        <p>In April 2019, Jack Ma, then executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a technology conglomerate, gave a speech about the 996 and <a onclick="openIframe('jackMa')">"wolf culture"</a> being the path to success. </p>
        <p class="blank">Blank</p>
        <p>996 is a concept in which people work from 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week. The promotion of the 996 work week is believed to be one of the <a onclick="openIframe('nine96')">direct causes</a> of the 'lying flat' movement.</p>
        <p class="blank">Blank</p>
        <p>In conjunction with this speech, workers in the technology sector in China set up a <a onclick="openIframe('gitHub')">GitHub Repository </a>called 996.ICU. The name 996.ICU refers to "Work by '996', sick in ICU", an ironic saying among Chinese developers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).  </p>

        <p>The first post to pick up momentum was posted on April 17th, 2021 by Luo Huazhong. His post was titled <a onclick="openIframe('lyingFlatJustice')">"Lying flat is justice"</a> that contained a text detailing his life of 2 years with no job and occasionally picking up work as a dead body extra in movies in Zhejiang province, accompanied by a picture of him lying down in a scene. </p>

        <p>In March 2022, Shanghai began going into a lockdown and officially locking down the whole city on April 1. At this time, the idea of lying flat once again entered the Chinese internet culture mainstream.</p>
        <p class="blank">Blank</p>
        <p>While this was not in direct reference to the previous movement about working, it shifted its focus to talking about dealing with the COVID-19 situation in China. China has been using a strict zero-covid policy to prevent the spread. However, many have called for this policy to be adapted and just lie flat with covid.</p>
        <p class="blank">Blank</p>
        <p>Top epidemiologists and netizens alike are calling for the end of these draconian measures for preventing the spread of disease, because while the policy has been able to prevent deaths from covid itself, the side effects of deaths related to the lockdown situation have been numerous. </p>
